# PHP Scrapping For (Gold - Silver - Palladium - Platinum) Prices.
***


## 1 - Introduction about our idea:
Here we fetched all the data I mean all the live prices and also the old prices related to gold, silver, platinum, or palladium. We bring from the best sites that collect the largest data as well as live data related to this region. They use some techniques that we understand very well and depend on that we collect data based on specific keys.

## 2 - Our Features:
Here, we have a PHP scrape fetched from 12 months, 9 months, 6 months, 3 months, 24 hours, and live data. 
Also, we have a variety if you want a specific number of months you will get it but don't forget it depends on the website to be scraped.

If you remember that our topic is talking about gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, then each of them has its own measurements such as grams, ounces, and kilograms. Accordingly, we cover all of these measurements for each of them for being accurate and back all things up as well as we can.

## 3 - Accessibility:
As we tried on our code that works on localhost such as Xampp and then we want to try on real servers like Hostgator.

## 4 - Few points show you how we get the data.:
It's actually looking for specific keys that you want to get the relevant data for. Sure, it depends on a lot of factors and depends on the code method you're extracting from the site. But our method, in this case, is to look for gold and its measurements and get all the data in the table, and then we have to filter out what is useless and take all the data that is useful for us in the array in a certain order before transferring it to the database.

## 5 - What are the benefits of this idea?
You can collect this data and create an interface such as a desktop or mobile application, or even a website. Nowadays most people focus on investing in things that involve little risk and at the same time, you will not put much effort to figure out what is the best time to invest in this area to save the value of your savings that you earned. So, the best way to serve these people is to create an interface that serves their needs to keep track of these prices every day and make them comfortable if you also get all the old data as you can to have the ability to meet their needs.
