# PHP Scrapping For (Gold - Silver - Palladium - Platinum) Prices.
***
## 1 - Our Features:
Here, we have a PHP scrape fetched from 12 months, 9 months, 6 months, 3 months, 24 hours, and live data. 
Also, we have a variety if you want a specific number of months you will get it but don't forget it depends on the website to be scraped.

## 2 - We Cover All of the measurements data:
If you remember that our topic is talking about gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, then each of them has its own measurements such as grams, ounces, and kilograms. Accordingly, we cover all of these measurements for each of them for being accurate and back all things up as well as we can.

***
## 3 - Accessibility:
Our code works on both real servers like Hostgator and localhost such as Xampp.

***
## 4 - Some points show you how we get the data.:
It's actually looking for specific keys that you want to get the relevant data for. Sure, it depends on a lot of factors and depends on the code method you're extracting from the site. But our method, in this case, is to look for gold and its measurements and get all the data in the table, and then we have to filter out what is useless and take all the data that is useful for us in the array in a certain order before transferring it to the database.
